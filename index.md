## **Welcome**

I am a computer scientist fascinated by the design and analysis of algorithms and the boundaries of intelligence. My focus is on exploring how large language models (LLMs) encode thought, language, and reasoning within finite dimensions—revealing insights into the limits of cognition and the potential of synthetic intelligence to surpass human intuition.

This is my personal website, where I share interesting papers, research ideas, news, pictures, and thoughts worth reflecting upon. It’s a space to explore questions, spark curiosity, and challenge perspectives about the nature of intelligence and the future of computation.
